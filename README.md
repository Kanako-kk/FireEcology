Objective: Does any of these plant characteristics affect live fuel moisture percentage?  <br />
 <br />
- Growth State🌱  <br />
- Nativity🌱  <br />
- Irrigation🌱  <br />
- Deciduous🌳 vs evergreen🌲  <br />
- Herbs🌿 vs Non-Herbs  <br />
- Conifers🌲 vs Non-Conifers🌳  <br />
- Resin🍁  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ipynb file: Cleaning of 4 csv files and merging<br />
R file: Data Visualization using data frames created by ipynb file<br />
Poster: Scientific poster created with Dr. Kate Wilkin, presented at SJSU <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Result: 
- Growth State🌱: As expected: Dead materials have lower avg fuel mositure  <br />
- Nativity🌱: Native plants have higher avg fuel moisture  <br />
- Irrigation🌱: No effect  <br />
- Deciduous🌳 vs evergreen🌲: Deciduous plants have higher avg fuel moisture   <br />
- Herbs🌿 vs Non-Herbs:Herbs plants  avg fuel moisture  <br />
- Conifers🌲 vs Non-Conifers🌳:Non-conifers have higher avg fuel moisture  <br />
- Resin🍁: No effect <br />
